# PROGRAMMING-IN-CPP

## Description
This repository contains a collection of C++ programs, ranging from basic examples demonstrating fundamental programming concepts to more complex pattern printing and number conversions. It serves as a learning resource for individuals starting their journey with C++ or those looking for specific code snippets.

## Features and Functionality

This repository showcases the following features:

*   **Basic Input/Output Operations:** Programs demonstrate how to take input from the user and display output. (e.g., `1. Determine no. is +VE or -VE.cpp`, `2. Determining no. is odd or even.cpp`)
*   **Conditional Statements:**  Examples use `if`, `else if`, and `else` statements for decision-making. (e.g., `3. Grading system on marks.cpp`, `4. Alphabet determination.cpp`)
*   **Loops:**  Demonstrates the use of `while` and `for` loops for repetitive tasks. (e.g., `6.Printing nos in serial.cpp`, `8.Print nos using for loop.cpp`)
*   **Mathematical Operations:** Programs calculate sums, factorials, and perform number conversions. (e.g., `9. Sum of nos between two.cpp`, `10.Calcuate sum of odd no between two nos.cpp`, `13. Getting Factorial of a number.cpp`)
*   **Pattern Printing:**  Examples print various patterns using nested loops, including square, triangle, pyramid, hollow diamond and butterfly patterns. (e.g., `14. pattern(5x10) using nested loop.cpp`, `18. Simple triangle Pattern.cpp`, `23.Pyramid Pattern.cpp`, `24. Hollow Diamond Pattern.cpp`, `25. Butterfly Pattern.cpp`)
*   **Functions:** Programs utilize functions to modularize code and perform specific tasks. (e.g., `26. Sum of digits in a number using function.cpp`, `27. Binomial Factorial Using Functions.cpp`, `28. Decimal to Binary number.cpp`, `29. Binary to Decimal conversion.cpp`)
*   **Number System Conversions:** Includes programs for converting between decimal and binary number systems. (e.g., `28. Decimal to Binary number.cpp`, `29. Binary to Decimal conversion.cpp`)
*   **Bitwise Operators:** Examples demonstrate the use of bitwise AND, OR, and XOR operators. (e.g., `30. BitWise & operator.cpp`, `30. BitWise &, or, XOr operators.cpp`)
*   **Arrays:** Programs demonstrate how to find the smallest and largest elements in an array. (e.g., `31. Smallest & largest (with index) in an array.cpp`)
*   **Object-Oriented Programming Concepts (OOP):** Demonstrates usage of singleton class and virtual functions for implementing polymorphism. (e.g., `Singleton_class(voidDeri).cpp`, `Virtual(voidDeri).cpp`)

## Technology Stack

*   **C++:**  The primary programming language used in this repository.
*   **iostream:** Standard library for input and output operations.
*   **climits:** Standard library for constant integer limits.

## Prerequisites

To compile and run the programs in this repository, you will need:

*   A C++ compiler (e.g., g++, clang).
*   A text editor or IDE for writing and editing code.

## Installation Instructions

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/VirajsNexus/PROGRAMMING-IN-CPP.git
    cd PROGRAMMING-IN-CPP
    ```

2.  **Compilation:**

    Use a C++ compiler to compile the desired program. For example, to compile `1. Determine no. is +VE or -VE.cpp` using `g++`:

    ```bash
    g++ "1. Determine no. is +VE or -VE.cpp" -o positive_negative
    ```

## Usage Guide

After successful compilation, you can execute the program.

1.  **Execution:**

    For the compiled example above:
    ```bash
    ./positive_negative
    ```

    The program will prompt you for input, if required. Follow the instructions provided in the program's output. For pattern printing programs, running the executable will directly print the pattern on the console. For example, running the compiled version of `14. pattern(5x10) using nested loop.cpp` will output a 5x10 star pattern.

## API Documentation
